    title: "üêõ Fix React/React-DOM version mismatch causing test failures",
    body: `## Description
Tests in the \`@s2mangas/react\` package are failing due to a version mismatch between React and React-DOM packages.

## Current Error
\`\`\`
Incompatible React versions: The "react" and "react-dom" packages must have the exact same version. Instead got:
- react:      19.0.0
- react-dom:  19.1.1
\`\`\`

## Impact
- All tests in the React package are failing (24/24 test suites)
- CI/CD pipeline is broken
- Development workflow is impacted

## Expected Behavior
- React and React-DOM should have matching versions
- All tests should pass successfully

## Proposed Solution
1. Update React to v19.1.1 to match React-DOM
2. Or downgrade React-DOM to v19.0.0 to match React
3. Add version constraints in package.json to prevent future mismatches

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] React and React-DOM versions match
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] No version mismatch errors in CI

**High** - Blocking development and testing`,

    title: "üîß Fix ESLint configuration issues with deprecated --ext flag",
    body: `## Description
The React package ESLint script is using the deprecated \`--ext\` flag which is no longer available in the new flat config system.

## Current Error
\`\`\`
Invalid option '--ext' - perhaps you meant '-c'?
You're using eslint.config.js, some command line flags are no longer available.
\`\`\`

## Impact
- Linting command fails
- Code quality checks are not running
- CI/CD pipeline affected

## Current Configuration
\`\`\`json
"lint": "eslint src --ext .ts,.tsx"
\`\`\`

## Proposed Solution
Update the lint script to use the new ESLint flat config pattern:
\`\`\`json
"lint": "eslint src/**/*.{ts,tsx}"
\`\`\`

## Additional Changes Needed
- Review \`eslint.config.js\` file to ensure proper flat config setup
- Update any other ESLint-related scripts if needed
- Update documentation if necessary

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Lint command runs without errors
- [ ] TypeScript and TSX files are properly linted
- [ ] CI pipeline passes linting checks

    title: "‚¨ÜÔ∏è Upgrade Storybook from 7.x to 8.x for React 19 compatibility",
    body: `## Description
The project is using Storybook 7.x which has multiple peer dependency warnings with React 19. Storybook 8.x provides better React 19 support.

## Current Issues
- Multiple peer dependency warnings for React 16-18 support
- Deprecated @storybook/testing-library package
- Potential compatibility issues with React 19 features

## Current Storybook Version
- Storybook: 7.6.17 - 9.1.1 (mixed versions)
- @storybook/testing-library: 0.2.2 (deprecated)

## Proposed Upgrade
- Upgrade to Storybook 8.x (latest stable)
- Replace @storybook/testing-library with @storybook/test
- Update all Storybook addons to compatible versions

## Benefits
- Full React 19 compatibility
- Better performance and features
- Modern testing utilities
- Reduced peer dependency warnings

## Migration Tasks
- [ ] Update Storybook core packages
- [ ] Replace deprecated testing-library with @storybook/test  
- [ ] Update addon packages
- [ ] Test existing stories for compatibility
- [ ] Update Storybook configuration if needed
- [ ] Update documentation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Storybook 8.x running without peer dependency warnings
- [ ] All existing stories working correctly
- [ ] React 19 features supported
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline updated

    title: "üêõ Remove duplicate expo-image mock files in native package",
    body: `## Description
The native package has duplicate manual mock files for expo-image causing Jest warnings during test execution.

## Current Warning
\`\`\`
jest-haste-map: duplicate manual mock found: expo-image
The following files share their name; please delete one of them:
  * <rootDir>/lib/typescript/commonjs/src/__mocks__/expo-image.d.ts
  * <rootDir>/lib/typescript/module/src/__mocks__/expo-image.d.ts
\`\`\`

## Impact
- Jest warnings during test runs
- Potential confusion about which mock is being used
- Build artifacts pollution

## Root Cause
The build process is generating TypeScript declaration files in both CommonJS and ES Module formats for the mock files, causing duplication in the lib directory.

## Proposed Solution
1. Exclude \`__mocks__\` directories from TypeScript compilation
2. Update \`tsconfig.build.json\` to prevent declaration file generation for mocks
3. Clean up existing duplicate files in lib directory

## Files to Update
- \`tsconfig.build.json\` - Add exclude pattern for mocks
- Build scripts - Ensure proper cleanup
- \`.gitignore\` - Ensure lib directory is properly ignored

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] No duplicate mock warnings during tests
- [ ] Mock files only exist in source directory
- [ ] TypeScript declarations not generated for mocks
- [ ] Tests continue to work correctly

## Priority
**Low** - Warning only, doesn't break functionality`,

    title: "üèóÔ∏è Establish consistent versioning strategy across packages",
    body: `## Description
The packages currently have inconsistent versioning which can cause confusion and dependency management issues.

## Current Versions
- \`@s2mangas/core\`: 1.0.3
- \`@s2mangas/react\`: 0.0.2  
- \`@s2mangas/native\`: 0.0.14

## Issues
- Large version gaps between packages
- No clear versioning strategy documented
- Potential breaking changes not properly communicated
- Dependency references may become outdated

## Proposed Strategy Options

### Option 1: Independent Versioning
- Each package maintains its own version
- Use semantic versioning strictly
- Document breaking changes clearly
- Benefits: Flexibility for different maturity levels

### Option 2: Synchronized Versioning
- All packages share the same major.minor version
- Patch versions can differ
- Easier dependency management
- Benefits: Simpler to understand compatibility

### Option 3: Monorepo Unified Versioning
- All packages always have identical versions
- Release all packages together
- Benefits: Guaranteed compatibility

## Recommended Approach
**Option 2: Synchronized Versioning**
- Align all packages to v1.x.x (core package level)
- Use changesets for automatic versioning
- Document version compatibility matrix

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Choose versioning strategy
- [ ] Update package versions to align
- [ ] Document versioning policy
- [ ] Update changesets configuration
- [ ] Create version compatibility documentation
- [ ] Add automated checks for version alignment

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Clear versioning strategy documented
- [ ] Package versions aligned according to strategy
- [ ] Automated tooling supports chosen strategy
- [ ] Developer documentation updated
