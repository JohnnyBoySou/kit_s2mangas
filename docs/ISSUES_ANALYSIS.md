# üìã Repository Issues Analysis

This document contains a comprehensive analysis of issues found in the S2Mangas UI Kit repository and recommendations for creating GitHub issues to track their resolution.

## üîç Analysis Summary

After analyzing the repository structure, codebase, dependencies, and testing infrastructure, I've identified **13 major issues** that should be tracked as GitHub issues for proper resolution.

## üö® Critical Issues (High Priority)

### 1. React/React-DOM Version Mismatch
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Impact**: All React package tests failing (24/24 test suites)
- **Current State**: react@19.0.0 vs react-dom@19.1.1
- **Solution**: Align versions and add constraints to prevent future mismatches

### 2. ESLint Configuration Issues  
- **Severity**: High
- **Impact**: Linting pipeline broken
- **Current State**: Using deprecated `--ext` flag with new flat config
- **Solution**: Update lint scripts and configuration

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium Priority Issues

### 3. Storybook Compatibility Issues
- **Issue**: Using Storybook 7.x with React 19 causing peer dependency warnings
- **Impact**: Developer experience degraded, potential compatibility issues
- **Solution**: Upgrade to Storybook 8.x

### 4. Inconsistent Package Versioning
- **Issue**: Core@1.0.3, React@0.0.2, Native@0.0.14
- **Impact**: Confusing dependency management
- **Solution**: Establish and document versioning strategy

### 5. Missing Automated Dependency Management
- **Issue**: No automated dependency updates
- **Impact**: Security vulnerabilities, manual maintenance burden
- **Solution**: Implement Dependabot or Renovate

## üîß Low Priority Issues

### 6. Duplicate Mock Files
- **Issue**: Jest warnings about duplicate expo-image mocks
- **Impact**: Warning messages only, tests still pass
- **Solution**: Exclude mocks from TypeScript declaration generation

## ‚ú® Feature Development Issues (Roadmap Items)

### 7. Date Picker Component
- **Status**: Listed as "Em Desenvolvimento" in README
- **Platforms**: React Web + React Native
- **Priority**: High feature request

### 8. File Upload Component
- **Status**: Listed as "Em Desenvolvimento" in README  
- **Platforms**: React Web + React Native
- **Priority**: High feature request

### 9. Data Grid Component
- **Status**: Listed as "Em Desenvolvimento" in README
- **Platforms**: React Web + React Native
- **Priority**: Medium feature request (complex component)

### 10. Charts and Visualization Components
- **Status**: Listed as "Em Desenvolvimento" in README
- **Platforms**: React Web + React Native  
- **Priority**: Medium feature request (complex component)

### 11. Calendar Component
- **Status**: Listed as "Em Desenvolvimento" in README
- **Platforms**: React Web + React Native
- **Priority**: Medium feature request

## üìö Documentation & Process Issues

### 12. Component Development Guidelines
- **Issue**: No documented standards for component development
- **Impact**: Inconsistent code quality and patterns
- **Solution**: Create comprehensive development guidelines

### 13. Missing Issue Templates
- **Issue**: No GitHub issue templates for bugs, features, or components
- **Impact**: Inconsistent issue reporting
- **Solution**: Create proper issue templates (‚úÖ **COMPLETED**)

## üéØ Recommended Action Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Week 1)
1. Fix React version mismatch
2. Fix ESLint configuration
3. Create GitHub issues for all identified problems

### Phase 2: Infrastructure Improvements (Week 2-3)  
1. Upgrade Storybook to 8.x
2. Implement automated dependency updates
3. Establish versioning strategy
4. Create component development guidelines

### Phase 3: Feature Development (Month 1-2)
1. Implement Date Picker component
2. Implement File Upload component
3. Plan complex components (Data Grid, Charts, Calendar)

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Month 2-3)
1. Implement Data Grid component
2. Implement Charts components
3. Implement Calendar component

## üìù Issue Creation Script

A Node.js script has been created at `scripts/create-issues.js` that contains all the issue definitions. This script can be used to programmatically create the issues using the GitHub API, or the issue content can be copied manually.

## üè∑Ô∏è Recommended Labels

The following labels should be created in the GitHub repository:

### Priority Labels
- `high-priority` - Critical issues blocking development
- `medium-priority` - Important but not blocking
- `low-priority` - Nice to have, can be delayed

### Type Labels  
- `bug` - Something isn't working
- `enhancement` - New feature or request
- `component` - Related to UI components
- `documentation` - Improvements or additions to documentation
- `tooling` - Build tools, CI/CD, development tools
- `maintenance` - Code maintenance and refactoring

### Package Labels
- `react` - Issues related to @s2mangas/react
- `native` - Issues related to @s2mangas/native  
- `core` - Issues related to @s2mangas/core

### Technology Labels
- `typescript` - TypeScript related issues
- `testing` - Test related issues
- `storybook` - Storybook related issues
- `eslint` - ESLint related issues
- `dependencies` - Dependency management issues
